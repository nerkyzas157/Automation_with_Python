## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Nerijus, and I'm on a journey to learn Python. This repository is a collection of my Automation projects, showcasing my progress and the skills I've acquired. I hope this can also serve as a resource for others who are learning Python and exploring automation.

## Highlighted Projects

### [ISS Tracker](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/Automation_with_Python/tree/main/ISS_Tracker)
- **Description:** This project involves creating an automated notification system that alerts the user via email when the International Space Station (ISS) is passing overhead during nighttime hours. The project utilizes the ISS and sunrise-sunset APIs to obtain the current position of the ISS and the local sunrise and sunset times. The program checks if the ISS is within a specified range of the user's coordinates and if it's currently nighttime. If both conditions are met, it sends an email notification. The script runs continuously, checking the conditions every 60 seconds.
- **Skills Highlighted:** This project highlights skills in API integration, using the Python Requests library for data fetching, parsing JSON data, employing the SMTP protocol for email notifications, automating tasks, and managing time-based operations.

### [Birthday Wisher](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/Automation_with_Python/tree/main/Birthday_Wisher)
- **Description:** This project automates the process of sending personalized birthday wishes via email. It reads birthday data from a CSV file, checks if today's date matches any birthday, and sends an email with a randomly selected birthday letter template. The project demonstrates how to handle date operations, read and manipulate data with pandas, and automate email sending using the SMTP protocol in Python.
- **Skills Highlighted:** File I/O, date manipulation, email automation, randomization, pandas, smtplib.
